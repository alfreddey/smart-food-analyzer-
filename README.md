# 🍽️ Smart Food Analyzer
**Deep Learning-Based Food Recognition and Dietary Assessment System**

Smart Food Analyzer is a web-based application that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to recognize food from images, estimate calories and macronutrients, and list common ingredients. It empowers individuals, nutritionists, and fitness coaches with instant, reliable dietary insights.

## Features
- **Food Image Recognition** – Upload a single food image and get instant classification.  
- **Nutrient & Calorie Estimation** – Fetch calorie, protein, fat, and carbohydrate values.  
- **Ingredient Lookup** – Retrieve a list of common ingredients for the detected meal.  
- **Interactive Visuals** – Donut charts for macronutrient distribution.  
- **Web-based Interface** – Responsive **React** frontend with **TailwindCSS**.  
- **Fast & Scalable** – **ExpressJS API** backed by **TensorFlow/Keras** models.  

---

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: NextJS + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js + ExpressJS REST API  
- **Model Training**: TensorFlow/Keras (Python, trained on Food-101 dataset)  
- **Database Integration**: Nutritionix/Spoonacular API for calorie & macronutrient data  
- **Deployment**: Runs in browser
